1) How to downlaod main git into local

download "Git bash into your system" ==> Search "Downlaod git bash in windows" - git-scm.com
now do the setup in local, next next is done, no additional steps is followed
now copy the rep path from your main and form a commad as below. for path of your rep it will be in main brach under share.
$git clone https://github.com/DonJays/ShareIt.git

change dr to where you need to create a file.

$git add file.txt

Now create a folder in your local and right click in your folder. You see an option "git bash"

2) How to create a local txt file in you local rep which you have cloned from internet.

you need to type below command to create a new txt file from bash
$touch file.txt

I created this txt file which you are reading now in my loacl and copied into main rep.

3) How to commit changes and push to main git

Now you have sucessfully created a txt file in your local. we need to commit into your local git rep first and then we will push into main git.

before this step we need to tell the bash who you are. define username, name and password
$git config --global user.email "mahesh08041998@gmail.com"
$git config --global user.name "Mahesh N"
$git config --global user.password "password"

now you have defined who you are, now we need to commit changes into your local rep.
$git commit -m "added a file file.txt"

Now you have commited into your local rep.

Time to push this changes into you main git.
$git push origin main

it will be redirecetd to browser git login page. provide your credentials and enter.
Now you will see your local txt file from your local rep is cloned into main git branch

For any doubts try to tribleshoot on your own, you are learning.
